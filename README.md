# Pandas

The goal of this project is to understand this traffic better, in particular the volume and distribution of events, and to develop ideas how to increase the links' clickrates.

The dataset constains web traffic data is used to answer the following questions-

1. How many total pageview events did the links in the provided dataset receive in the full period, how many per day?
2. What about the other recorded events?
3. Which countries did the pageviews come from?
4. What was the overall click rate (clicks/pageviews)?
5. How does the clickrate distribute across different links?
6. Is there any correlation between clicks and previews on a link? Is it significant? How large is the effect? Make sure to at least test for potential linear as well as categorical (think binary) relationships between both variables.
